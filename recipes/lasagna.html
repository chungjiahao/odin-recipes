    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This hearty lasagna recipe layers rich flavors for a comforting, classic Italian dish. 
        It starts with a savory meat sauce made by simmering ground beef and garlic with crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend of Italian herbs. While the sauce thickens, a creamy ricotta mixture is prepared by combining ricotta cheese with a beaten egg, grated Parmesan, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. 
        In a baking dish, uncooked or boiled lasagna noodles are layered with the meat sauce, the ricotta mixture, and generous handfuls of shredded mozzarella cheese. 
        These layers are repeated until the dish is full, topped with mozzarella and Parmesan, then baked until bubbly and golden on top. After resting for 10â€“15 minutes, the lasagna is ready to serve, revealing its delicious, cheesy layers.</p>
