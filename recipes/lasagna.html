    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This hearty lasagna recipe layers rich flavors for a comforting, classic Italian dish. 
        It starts with a savory meat sauce made by simmering ground beef and garlic with crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend of Italian herbs. While the sauce thickens, a creamy ricotta mixture is prepared by combining ricotta cheese with a beaten egg, grated Parmesan, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. 
        In a baking dish, uncooked or boiled lasagna noodles are layered with the meat sauce, the ricotta mixture, and generous handfuls of shredded mozzarella cheese. 
        These layers are repeated until the dish is full, topped with mozzarella and Parmesan, then baked until bubbly and golden on top. After resting for 10–15 minutes, the lasagna is ready to serve, revealing its delicious, cheesy layers.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Flat Sheets of Lasagna</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Ricotta</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the meat sauce
In a large skillet, cook ground beef with minced garlic over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat, then add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, basil, and oregano. Let it simmer for 20–30 minutes to develop flavor.</li>
        <li>Mix the ricotta filling
In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with a beaten egg, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Boil the lasagna noodles (if using non-oven-ready noodles)
Cook noodles in salted boiling water according to package instructions. Drain and lay flat on parchment paper to prevent sticking.

        </li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna
In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.
Add a layer of lasagna noodles.

Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture.

Spoon over more meat sauce.

Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella.
Repeat the layers until the dish is full, finishing with a layer of sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.></li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna
Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 20–25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Let it rest
Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set for cleaner serving.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy
Cut into squares and serve warm with garlic bread or a fresh salad.</li>
