    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Pizza has a rich, satisfying taste that balances savory, tangy, and slightly sweet flavors. The crust is warm and chewy or crisp depending on the style, providing a comforting base. Melted cheese adds creaminess and a salty depth, while the tomato sauce gives a burst of tangy sweetness with hints of garlic and herbs. Toppings like pepperoni or vegetables bring extra flavor — spicy, smoky, fresh, or earthy — creating a delicious, well-rounded bite every time</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Dough</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy. Add flour, salt, and olive oil, and knead until smooth. Cover and let the dough rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Roll out the dough on a floured surface and place it on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread the sauce evenly over the dough, sprinkle with cheese, and add your favorite toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let it cool slightly, slice, and serve hot.</li>
