    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        Ramen has a rich, comforting taste that blends savory umami flavors with subtle sweetness and saltiness. 
        The broth, whether it's creamy tonkotsu, soy-based shoyu, or miso-infused, carries deep, slow-cooked notes that warm the palate. Slurping the noodles adds a chewy texture that soaks up the broth’s essence, while toppings like soft-boiled eggs, marinated pork, green onions, and nori bring layers of flavor—ranging from smoky to tangy to slightly briny. 
        Overall, ramen delivers a satisfying and complex taste that feels both hearty and soulful.

        <h4>Noodles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh ramen noodles (wheat-based, alkaline noodles)</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Tare (seasoning base)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Soy sauce (for shoyu ramen)</li>
                <li>Miso paste (for miso ramen)</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Toppings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Chashu (braised pork belly)</li>
                <li>Egg</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin, prepare the ramen broth by placing pork bones in a large pot and covering them with cold water. Bring the pot to a boil for a few minutes to release impurities, then discard the water, rinse the bones, and clean the pot. Refill the pot with fresh water, add the cleaned bones, and include aromatics like onion, garlic, ginger, and scallions. Let this simmer for 8 to 12 hours, occasionally skimming the surface. For extra depth, you can add kombu and dried mushrooms during the last hour. The result will be a rich, milky, umami-packed tonkotsu broth.</li>
            <li>While the broth simmers, prepare the tare—the seasoning base that defines the flavor style of your ramen. For shoyu tare, mix soy sauce, mirin, and a bit of dashi (or broth); for miso tare, combine miso paste with sake and sesame oil. In a separate pan, cook chashu pork by simmering a slab of pork belly in a mix of soy sauce, sugar, sake, and aromatics until it’s tender and flavorful. Slice it thinly once cooled. You can also prepare marinated eggs by soft-boiling them for 6–7 minutes and soaking them in a soy-based marinade for a few hours</li>
            <li>When you’re ready to serve, cook the fresh ramen noodles in boiling water for 2–3 minutes until just tender, then drain. In each serving bowl, pour in a few spoonfuls of tare, then ladle over the hot broth. Add the noodles and gently swirl to mix the flavors. Top with slices of chashu pork, a marinated egg, chopped green onions, nori, and any other toppings like bamboo shoots or bean sprouts. Serve immediately while steaming hot, and enjoy the deep, layered flavors of your homemade ramen.</li>
